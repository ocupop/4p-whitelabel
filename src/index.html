<p class="lead">Welcome to the INOVA Farm Share Program! As part of our commitment to employee wellness, we are partnering with 4P
Foods, a local food hub to distribute weekly farm share boxes to our staff. Knowing that the food we all eat plays an
integral role in our personal health, INOVA wants to support local, seasonal farmers, while at the same time making it
easier for our team members to access their food.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">What Is It?</h4>
<p>INOVA Farm Share is sort of like a CSA – Community Supported Agriculture – only it offers a bit more flexibility. Every
Saturday, you will receive a weekly newsletter letting you know what is available from the local farmers, along with
recipe ideas to go with the menus. You can then mix-and-match your choices, including local produce, meat, dairy, and
pantry items. You order will then be aggregated from the local farmers and delivered to the INOVA location of your
choice on Thursdays. More questions? Check out this link for more information.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Why INOVA Farm Share?</h4>
<p>At Inova, we know that the quality of the food people consume has a direct effect on their health. We also recognize the
benefits of buying locally, which include fresher, riper and generally healthier food, a more robust local economy and a
reduced carbon footprint. We are committed to providing our employees with healthy food options and supporting the
production efforts of local farmers.</p>
