            Welcome to the Inova CSA Program! As part of our commitment to team member wellness, we are partnering with a
            local
            food hub to distribute weekly farm share boxes to our staff. Knowing that the food we all eat plays an
            integral role
            in our personal health, Inova wants to support local, seasonal farmers, while at the same time making it
            easier for
            our team members to access their food.

          <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">What Is It?</h4>
          <p>Inova CSA – Community Supported Agriculture – allows Inova team members access to local food with a bit more
            flexibility than a typical CSA program. Every Saturday, you will receive a <a
              href="https://4pfoods.com/weekly-newsletter/" target="whtlbl">weekly newsletter</a> letting you know what is
            available from the <a href="https://4pfoods.com/category/blog/farmer-profiles/page/3/" target="whtlbl">local
              farmers</a>, along with recipe ideas to go with the menus. You can then mix-and-match your choices,
            including
            local produce, meat, dairy, and pantry items. You order will then be aggregated from the local farmers and
            delivered
            to the Inova location of your choice on Thursdays. More questions? <a

            information.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Why INOVA CSA?</h4>
          <p>At Inova, we know that the quality of the food people consume has a direct effect on their health. We also
            recognize the benefits of buying locally, which include fresher, riper and generally healthier food, a more
            robust
            local economy and a reduced carbon footprint. We are committed to providing our team members with healthy food
            options
            and supporting the production efforts of local farmers.</p>
