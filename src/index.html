                Welcome to the Inova CSA Program! As part of our commitment to employee wellness, we are partnering a local food hub to
                distribute weekly farm share boxes to our staff. Knowing that the food we all eat plays an integral role in our personal
                health, Inova wants to support local, seasonal farmers, while at the same time making it easier for our team members to
                access their food.

              <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">What Is It?</h4>
              <p>Inova CSA – Community Supported Agriculture – allows Inova employees access to local food with a bit more flexibility
              than a typical CSA program. Every Saturday, you will receive a <a href="https://4pfoods.com/weekly-newsletter/" target="whtlbl">weekly newsletter</a> letting you know what is available from
              the <a href="https://4pfoods.com/category/blog/farmer-profiles/page/3/" target="whtlbl">local farmers</a>, along with recipe ideas to go with the menus. You can then mix-and-match your choices, including
              local produce, meat, dairy, and pantry items. You order will then be aggregated from the local farmers and delivered to
              the INOVA location of your choice on Thursdays. More questions? <a href="https://4pfoods.com/category/blog/impact/" target="whtlbl">Check out this link</a> for more information.</p>

              <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Why INOVA CSA?</h4>
              <p>At Inova, we know that the quality of the food people consume has a direct effect on their health. We also recognize the
              benefits of buying locally, which include fresher, riper and generally healthier food, a more robust local economy and a
              reduced carbon footprint. We are committed to providing our employees with healthy food options and supporting the
              production efforts of local farmers.</p>
