              <p class="lead">Welcome to the INOVA Farm Share Program! As part of our commitment to employee wellness,
                we are
                partnering with 4P
                Foods, a local food hub to distribute weekly farm share boxes to our staff. Knowing that the food we all
                eat plays an
                integral role in our personal health, INOVA wants to support local, seasonal farmers, while at the same
                time making it
                easier for our team members to access their food.</p>
              <hr>
              <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">What Is It?</h4>
              <p>INOVA Farm Share is sort of like a CSA – Community Supported Agriculture – only it offers a bit more
                flexibility.
                Every Saturday, you will receive a weekly newsletter letting you know what is available from the local
                farmers, along with
                recipe ideas to go with the menus. You can then mix-and-match your choices, including local produce,
                meat, dairy, and
                pantry items. You order will then be aggregated from the local farmers and delivered to the INOVA
                location of your
                choice on Thursdays. More questions? Check out this link for more information.</p>

              <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Why INOVA Farm Share?</h4>
              <p>At Inova, we know that the quality of the food people consume has a direct effect on their health. We
                also recognize
                the benefits of buying locally, which include fresher, riper and generally healthier food, a more robust
                local economy and
                a reduced carbon footprint. We are committed to providing our employees with healthy food options and
                supporting the
                production efforts of local farmers.</p>
