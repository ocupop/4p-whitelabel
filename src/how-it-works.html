            <h5>The Details</h5>
            <p><em>The Inova CSA Program</em> sources farm-fresh food from farms in the Washington DC local foodshed and delivers them to your office or
            apartment building once each week. Once you sign up, we’ll email you a day or so before your delivery arrives with what
            you can expect as well as recipe ideas and other info about what’s in your bag, and where it came from. We’ll also
            remind you to bring your bag back to the building drop site so we can pick it and reuse it. Then when we show up with
            the delivery, we’ll ping you again, so you can get it. Simple, huh? We’ve got a variety of sizes and products to fit any
            household and budget. It is easy to skip deliveries or donate them to local food bank partners (as long as you let us
            know at least 48 hrs in advance) and you only get charged for what you use or donate.</p>

            <h5>But That's not all</h5>
            <p>For every 10th bag we sell, <em>The Inova CSA Program</em> donates a bag to local food bank partners, an incredible non-profit here in DC that
            has been helping local families for years. The influx of top-quality, healthy food will make a real difference for
            people who usually have to settle for super-processed factory food. Plus, your food money stays local, helping family
            farmers to build strong businesses by expand the production of the healthy foods we should all be eating anyway. That’s
            the beauty of building food communities.</p>
