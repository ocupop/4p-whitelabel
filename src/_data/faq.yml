  questions:
    - q: WHERE DO WE SOURCE OUR FOOD?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Much of our produce comes from small family farms in Virginia,
        Maryland and southern Pennsylvania. We also work with local food
        producers in the DC region to source delicious pickles, jams,
        sauerkraut, granolas, kombucha, and other value-added items. Each week
        you will receive more specifics on the exact farms your food comes from
        in our Weekly Harvest Newsletter, delivered to your inbox every
        Saturday.</p>
    - q: IS IT ORGANIC? WHAT ABOUT NON-GMO?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Some of it is organic and some of it is not. The certification
        process for USDA Organic is lengthy and expensive, so not all of the
        farmers we work with have chosen to become certified. We are firmly
        against the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides as well as the
        use of GMO seeds and feed.We do our best to ensure that all of the
        farmers we work with align with this value system. It may be several
        years until enough farms in the DC foodshed have been certified for us
        to change the answer to this question to a simple yes. Until then, we
        hope that you will help us to support those farmers that we have
        identified as being good stewards of the land and the animals under
        their care.</p>
    - q: WHERE DO I FIND OUT MORE ABOUT YOUR FARMERS?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Check out our Farmer Profiles page! We’re always updating it, so stay
        tuned for more profiles from the farmers we source from the most.</p>
    - q: WHAT IF I WANT TO SKIP A DELIVERY?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Go for it. On your account management page you have the option to
        skip or donate your subscription for up to 6 months at a time. If you
        skip, we won’t deliver your order and we won’t charge you. If you choose
        to donate your order, you will still pay for it, but we will deliver it
        to a family in need through our partnerships with Fauquier Food Bank,
        Martha’s Table, and YMCA Capital View instead. All we ask is that you
        skip any coming deliveries ahead of the 2-day cut-off period during
        which we have already put an order in with our farmers for our
        deliveries that week. The cut off begins at 11:59pm on Sunday for a
        Wednesday delivery; 11:59pm on Monday for a Thursday delivery; and
        11:59pm on Tuesday for a Friday delivery.</p>
    - q: HOW DO I SKIP?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>When skipping, just log into your account and go to “Subscriptions.”
        Under Subscriptions, you will see each of the types of shares you have,
        and underneath each one there will be a few different buttons. Click the
        “Skip” button.   When you click it another box will open showing four
        dates for the current month; they’ll be green by default. By clicking on
        “Delivery Options” under any of these dates, you’ll get an option either
        to skip a delivery or donate that week’s delivery to one of our food
        pantry partners. The date will change from green to light blue when you
        skip, or to dark blue when you donate. Then you’re all set!   You can
        also use the arrows at the bottom to set your schedule for the next six
        months. Just make sure to check back six months later to do it again! If
        you need to skip the upcoming week, make sure to skip before your skip
        deadline or the online system will not allow you to skip since it is
        past the cut-off. This is very important, so we can finalize numbers for
        our farmers!</p>
    - q: WHAT IF I WANT TO SKIP LATE?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Please don’t, if you can avoid it! However, accidents do happen,
        especially if it’s your first time. Our skip deadlines are very
        important so that we can make sure we are able to fine-tune our orders
        with our farmers and minimize waste. However, if you really want to skip
        late, you could opt to donate your bag to one of our food pantry
        partners that week. Just email us at community@4pfoods.com and let us
        know.</p>
    - q: IS THERE A MINIMUM COMMITMENT?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>There is no minimum commitment and no tricky sign-up policy. Cancel
        anytime before your skip deadline – (but it might be worth a call or
        email to customer service first).</p>
    - q: WHAT DO YOU DELIVER?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We deliver healthy, sustainable, and purposeful food from farms
        within the DC foodshed. In the Spring, that means asparagus and
        strawberries. Summer, tomatoes and sweet corn. Autumn, = apples and
        leafy greens. And in the Winter, some of our greenhouse products like
        sprouts, lettuce, and maybe even some heirloom popcorn. Year-round it
        means great local meats and dairy where the animals are raised on open
        pasture and treated with dignity throughout their lives. In short, we
        deliver the bounty of your local foodshed, harvested daily and delivered
        to you. With 4P Foods you are voting with your fork for a more
        sustainable and equitable food system for everyone.</p>
    - q: IS MY BUILDING PARTICIPATING?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Maybe! Email, call, or inquire through our website. We’d be happy to
        look at your address and tell you if your building is already
        participating. If not, we’ll do everything we can to get your building
        signed up as soon as we can.   You can also sign up for direct home
        delivery if you live in an individual home. There is a $5 delivery fee
        to cover our overhead costs – it’s per delivery, not per bag.</p>
    - q: HOW DO I FIND OUT WHAT FOOD IS IN THE BAG THIS WEEK?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Each Saturday we send out a Weekly Harvest Newsletter straight to
        your inbox, making it simple to decide whether to order that week’s
        share or skip. We also include recipe ideas for all our delicious
        ingredients! If for some reason you are not receiving the email
        newsletter, email us at community@4pfoods.com so we can look into it.
        Make sure to check your spam folder, and if you are a gmail user, your
        promotions folder!</p>
    - q: WHAT IS MY DELIVERY DAY?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>As a tiny company we try to maximize our delivery efficiency as much
        as possible. To do that, we deliver to different neighborhoods on
        different days. Please email or call us if you have questions, but
        generally our delivery schedule is as follows:</p> <p>Wednesday: Most of
        Washington, DC (excluding Georgetown, Tenleytown, Woodley Park &
        Friendship Heights).</p> <p>Thursday: Georgetown and most of Northern
        Virginia (excluding Alexandria).</p> <p>Friday: Most of Maryland,
        Alexandria, Friendship Heights, Tenleytown, & Woodley Park DC.</p>
    - q: CAN I CUSTOMIZE?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Yes and no. 4PFoods operates like a supped up CSA
        (community-supported agriculture). Traditional CSA’s include a weekly
        selection of whatever is local and seasonal that week, and we do too.  
        We offer an online platform where you can customize your bags week to
        week. Simply login after you receive your newsletter and before your
        skip deadline.   Don’t like kale? Maybe swap them out for extra sweet
        potatoes. We also keep a selection of great value-added items from
        awesome local producers, such as jams, sauerkraut, pickles, granola,
        dried beans, flours, honey, salad dressing, etc., so feel free to swap
        out produce for those items and try them out.   Have a Dairy share, but
        don’t like milk? No worries – you can customize to have no milk, and add
        extra yogurt or cheese if you prefer. Or if you prefer low-fat milk or
        plain yogurt, you can make substitutions there.   Don’t like beef, but
        love chicken? Feel free to select from a list of extra cuts of meat in
        our freezer and build your own Protein share.   The online swapping
        system is points-based and points don’t roll over week to week – but you
        do get a few extra points to play around with each week. Please read
        more about the online swapping system here!</p>
    - q: WHAT IF I’M ALLERGIC TO SOMETHING?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>When you create your account, there is a box called “Dietary
        Restrictions.” You can fill this out with any allergies or foods you
        should avoid. Our operations team will check these when bags are being
        packed up.   Note though, it’s much easier if you swap out the offending
        items yourself with our online swapping system and pick extra items you
        would appreciate more! We are humans (although veggie robots would be
        cool), so unfortunately we do make mistakes from time to time when
        packing bags. If you do receive an item you can’t have, please email us
        and we will give you a refund.</p>
    - q: HOW DOES DELIVERY WORK?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>This will depend on your building, and every building is different.
        But in general:   If you signed up for direct home delivery, we usually
        deliver the bags right to your doorstep.   For larger buildings such as
        commercial buildings or apartment complexes, we deliver the bags to a
        front desk with a concierge, to a leasing office, or management
        office.   For some of our office deliveries, we deliver straight to your
        office (usually to the receptionist desk).   And of course, there might
        be some exceptions with other buildings. When you sign up, we’ll send
        you a welcome email within a few days after to clarify pick up details.
        But please feel free to reach out to us directly if you’re not sure!  
        For all deliveries, you will receive an automatic email notification
        when our driver drops off your bag.</p>
    - q: HOW IS THE FOOD DELIVERED? WILL IT STAY FRESH?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>As long as you can pick up your food that day, you should be fine. We
        deliver our produce in insulated tote bags to keep everything fresh. For
        our meat, dairy, and eggs, we deliver them in nifty insulted cooler
        boxes to keep everything cold for up to 24 hours.   You’ll also receive
        an email notification when your bag arrives, so you know when it’s
        available.</p>
    - q: WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE OLD BAGS?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We would love to have them back! To help keep our costs down and keep
        our deliveries sustainable, please return the old tote bags and cooler
        boxes (tote bag, insulation and cardboard box included!). We’ll send you
        a reminder email a day before your delivery. You can leave them where
        you pick up your bag, and our drivers will pick them up on their next
        delivery. We’ll then sanitize them for reuse. Win-win! And thank
        you!</p>
    - q: WHEN DOES BILLING HAPPEN?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We do our billing every Saturday after you receive your delivery. So
        if you got a bag on Wednesday, you’ll be billed that Saturday. If you
        skipped, you won’t be billed that week.</p>
    - q: WHAT IF I RECEIVE DAMAGED PRODUCE OR MY DELIVERY IS MISSING AN ITEM?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>If you receive any disappointing veggies or sad produce, please let
        us know! Similarly, if something is missing, reach out. You can email us
        at community@4pfoods.com and we’ll gladly try to correct whatever
        happened, whether through a refund or an extra item in your next
        delivery.</p>
    - q: HOW DO I STORE THIS?! HOW THE HECK DO I COOK RUTABAGE?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>If you have any questions at all on how to store your delicious
        produce so it lasts longer, check out our storage tips blog entry. We’ve
        also collected a bunch of helpful cooking resources to get you started.
        There are some great tutorials online – everything from the best way to
        cut an onion, how to sear a steak, and details about cooking techniques
        such as steaming, braising, and roasting. Need recipes? Check out our
        4PFoods pinterest board. We update it every week when we put together
        our weekly harvest newsletter, which will have a list of recipes itself.
        The recipes in the newsletter will be curated to reflect the food we are
        getting that week, while the pinterest board will have recipes organized
        by what type of food or veggie you are using. Looking for recipes for
        beets? Winter squash? Collard greens? We’ve got you covered! If you
        don’t use pinterest and are a 4PFoods member, feel free to email us
        about our guest Pinterest account.</p>
    - q: WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WINTER?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>It may be hard to believe, but we deliver year-round! Learn how we
        bring you delicious Winter produce here, and about our decision (after
        extensive member feedback) to source some non-local, seasonal produce in
        Winter.</p>
    - q: 'REFERRING A FRIEND, AND OTHER PROMOTIONS'
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Here are some promotions we offer!</p> <p>Refer a friend, and you
        both get $10 off. Simply share the promo code 4PFRIENDS with your buddy,
        and they’ll get $10 off their first bag. Email us when they sign up and
        you get a $10 refund.</p> <p>Refer your office! We are always looking
        for new office buildings to deliver to. When you put us in touch with
        your office to schedule a “meet & greet” (where we come to tell more of
        our story, how it works, etc.) we will give you a free small produce
        bag.</p> <p>Share 4PFoods on Social media! If you share your 4PFoods
        creations on social media and tag us, we’ll give you one Farmer Pete
        Squish toy in one of your upcoming deliveries.</p>
